# usage-gulp [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/goel4ever/usage-gulp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/goel4ever/usage-gulp)
Sample gulp tasks encoded for future references focusing on Workflow Management.<br>
[Check out the 'notes' folder for further details]

## Assumptions
You have node and npm installed already.

## Usage
To be decided. As of now dumping code.

## Let's talk about WorkFlow Management
There is no right way to do it, but what majority of workforce understands and avoids most of the manual process. WFM can be achieved in several ways depending on the consumer's choice. 
Here is a brief synopsis of different types:

1. Do all processing based the files listed in index html

2. Process all the files in package and give a final file name(s) to index.html

Sort notes:
Think about local development ease
Ease of packaging
Ease of change management
Ease of third party code import management
Check if you could preen third party code

Directory structure?? Does it matter?
Can WFM be independent of directory structure or even close to?
What am I going to give you via this project?
